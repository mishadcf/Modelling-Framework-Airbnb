# Airbnb Listings Prediction Project

## Overview
This project applies machine learning techniques to predict nightly prices of Airbnb listings and classify listing categories using synthetic data. It includes a series of Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts that cover the complete data science workflow from exploratory data analysis (EDA) to model training, tuning, and evaluation.

## Project Structure
- **`EDA.ipynb`**: Exploratory Data Analysis to uncover insights from the data.
- **`model_training.py`**: Scripts to train, tune, and evaluate predictive models.
- **`utils.py`**: Utility functions for data handling and model management.
- **`models/`**: Directory containing trained models and their metrics for easy access and reproducibility.

## Models Developed
- **Linear Regression**: For baseline predictions of listing prices.
- **Decision Trees and Random Forest**: For more complex regression tasks with structured decision making.
- **Gradient Boosting**: To improve predictions through ensemble learning.
- **Classification Models**: For determining the category of listings, optimized with hyperparameter tuning.

## Key Technologies
- **Python**: The primary programming language used.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: For data manipulation and numerical operations.
- **Scikit-learn**: For implementing machine learning algorithms.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For creating visualizations.
- **Joblib**: For model persistence.
